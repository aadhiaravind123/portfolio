                  <p>    My name is Aadhi Aravind and my career goal is to become a video game designer or software engineer. My plans to achieve my goal is to take classes that are related to both of the topics like video game design, and computer science classes. I want to first try out all of them and if I like the pathway I might pursue that career. I like to play video games as it is my favorite thing to do when I’m bored and am curious to find out how to do it. Computer Science is fun since I can create new things that can be helpful to others.</p>

                  <p>   I have some experience with coding as I have taken some summer courses in JavaScript and Python. I like to help others as you get a feel of satisfaction that you can get just by doing things by yourself. I also like to work in a team as it builds cooperation skills and your work is cut out for you. I am also responsible as I do my work on time and take full responsibility for my actions if I don’t do it thoroughly. I also can do my work independently, but I prefer to work in a team or partner.
                  I haven’t achieved that much in high school as I have only been in high school for only about 15 weeks.
                  I am apart of the Robotics Club and in the dev team.</p>
                  <p>  Over my experiences, I have learned that clubs are a good way to meet new people outside of your grade and also to learn the basic skills of engineering. I learned that when taking some advanced classes it is good to get help if you need, as there are many resources at our school. Also, it is best to manage your time so that you don’t spend all of your time doing homework. All in all, there are many qualities that I have which can help in the future. Thank you for your time to read this autobiography. Please take some time to explore my webpage.
